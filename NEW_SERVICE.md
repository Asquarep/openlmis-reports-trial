## Checklist in creating a new service

1. git clone this repository to a new one.
2. rename all the template-service pieces to your new service name
3. change README sections to be links to README in template-service (if you don't want to modify those sections, linking to
them in template service means we can update in one repo)
4. create the Jenkin's jobs
5. Publish the Service to DockerHub
6. add Service in Blue
7. update Read The Docs
